# Clean Architecture

A starting point for Clean Architecture with ASP.NET Core. [Clean Architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) is just the latest in a series of names for the same loosely-coupled, dependency-inverted architecture. You will also find it named [hexagonal](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture), [ports-and-adapters](http://www.dossier-andreas.net/software_architecture/ports_and_adapters.html), or [onion architecture](http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-1/).

This architecture is used in the [DDD Fundamentals course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/fundamentals-domain-driven-design) by [Steve Smith](https://ardalis.com) and [Julie Lerman](https://thedatafarm.com/). Contact Steve's company, [NimblePros](https://nimblepros.com/), for Clean Architecture or DDD training and/or implementation assistance for your team.
